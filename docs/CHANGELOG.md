# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

In this sense, we interpret the "Public API" of a hardware module as its port/parameter list.
Versions of the IP in the same major relase are "pin-compatible" with each other. Minor relases are permitted to add new parameters as long as their default bindings ensure backwards compatibility.
